/**
 * A simple startup task that triggers installation of the Google Cloud SDK if applicable.
 *
 * <p>earlyStartup() is called on a non-UI worker thread and runs before the Eclipse Workbench is
 * actually rendered. Since installing the SDK takes some time, we launch a WorkspaceJob to wait
 * until the workbench is actually up and running, especially so we don't slow down startup. Our use
 * of a wait and WorkbenchJob also ensures that our job doesn't start if the user realizes they made
 * a mistake and quickly exits.
